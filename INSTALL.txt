This module allows users to assign a Creative Commons license to the content 
of a node.  It uses to Creatve Commons API to update when new licenses are 
made available.

Licenses are diplayed using a Creative Commons license block.

Administators can also select a site license, which can be displayed in the 
footer of each page.

== Installation ==
1.  Uncompress the creativecommons.tar.gz file to your modules directory.

2.  Turn on the module under admin > modules.

3.  Under admin > settings > Creative Commons, set up the module.  Note that 
you must have at least one license selected (under "License Selection") for 
the module to work.  You can also, optionally, select required metadata 
fields, and the manner in which the license will be displayed.

4. Under admin > settings > Creative Commons > default you can set a default license for the entire site.

5.  Under admin > settings > Creative Commons > site license, you can choose to use the default license as a site-wide license to be displayed on every page.

6.  [not yet implemented] Under admin > content > configure > default workflow, you can select
which node types can have a license appended to them.  For example, you
might wish to allow Creative Commons licenses to be atttached to blog
posts, but not to forum posts.

7.  Under admin > users > configure > permissions, select the user roles
that will have permission to attach licenses to nodes.

8.  That's all folks... now your users can assign a Creative Commons
license to their new content.
