This module allows users to assign a Creative Commons license to the content 
of a node.  It uses to Creatve Commons API to update when new licenses are 
made available.

Licenses are diplayed using a Creative Commons Node License block.

Administators can also set the default license as a site-wide license, which
can be displayed with the Creative Commons Site License block.

== Installation ==
NOTE: if you installed a 6.x-dev snapshot from early July (or earlier than July),
you may have to reinstall the module in order to get the database schema updates
need to run

1.  Uncompress the creativecommons.tar.gz file to your modules directory.

2.  Turn on the module under admin > modules.

3.  Under admin > settings > Creative Commons, set up the module.  Note that 
you must have at least one license selected (under "License Selection") for 
the module to work.  You can also, optionally, select required metadata 
fields, and the manner in which the license will be displayed.

4. Under admin > settings > Creative Commons > site defaults you can set a 
default license type and jurisdiction for the site, which can optionally be used
as a site-wide license.

5. Under admin > settings> Creative Commons > content types, you can select
which node types can have a license appended to them.  For example, you
might wish to allow Creative Commons licenses to be attached to blog
posts, but not to forum posts.

6. [not yet implemented] Under admin > users > configure > permissions, select the user roles
that will have permission to attach licenses to nodes.

7.  That's all folks... now your users can assign a Creative Commons
license to their new content.
