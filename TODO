TODO LIST
////////////////////

Perhaps show/hide questions in divs, rather than reload the page in the 
license selection form.

Figure out why <script> is not loaded by drupal_set_html_head() in the 
Democractica theme.  Other themes seem to work fine.

Preserve metadata when "no license" is selected for preview, so that if a 
license is then chosen the metadata is not lost.

Clean up the UI issues for the license selection form, "autofill" button, 
etc.  

Add link to save a set of metadata to a user's preferences, so they don't 
have to re-enter the same content everytime they submit content.
